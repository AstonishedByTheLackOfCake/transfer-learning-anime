Warning: This repository size is quite big (approx. 100 MB) since it includes training & test images.

## Introduction

In Flag #15, we can see that Transfer Learning works really well with 3 different anime characters: Nishikino Maki, Kotori Minami, and Ayase Eli.

In this experiment, we will try to push Transfer Learning further, by using 3 different anime characters which have hair color similarity: Nishikino Maki, Takimoto Hifumi, and Sakurauchi Riko.
